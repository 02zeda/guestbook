# THE OPENSAUCED GUESTBOOK

This guestbook is a place for people who have taken [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza)'s "Open Source for Beginners" course to take their first steps into contributing to open source.

While there's an automated bot that will help you add yourself to the contributor's list via an issue, we recommend actually editing the `.all-contributors` file to get more experience with pull requests and reviews.

## How to add yourself to the guestbook

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit the `.all-contributors` file and add yourself to the list of contributors following the same object structure as the one that's already there. You can find the emoji key [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).
3. Commit your changes and open a pull request
4. Once your pull request is merged, you'll be able to see yourself in the contributors list, and you'll have made a valid open source contribution!

You can then add this to your [OpenSauced](https://opensauced.pizza) resume and profile as outlined in the course!
